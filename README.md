# Practice: Creating a Webpage using the basics of HTML focusing on Forms

### Practice working with HTML Forms

-   [ ] Simple practice to gain a better understanding of HTML and how to create a webpage with the concept of Building a Form page for a new website called "Welp!"
    -   [ ] it will be a review site like Yelp that will be reviwing anything from books to film to public parks, etc..

-   [ ] form element:
    -   [ ] user enters information
    -   [ ] user presses "Submit" button
    -   [ ] then something happens
-   [ ] label element -> literally gives a label or name so the user knows what type of data they are expected to enter
-   [ ] input element -> how the data is inputted by the use
    -   [ ] type attribute -> determines the type of input used and there are various types:
        -   [ ] input type = "text" -> plain textbox on a form
        -   [ ] input type = "radio" -> similar to the checkbox, radio buttons are a list of options, but only one choice can be selected at a time
            -   [ ] in order to ensure that only one choice can be selected at a time, must have the following name attribute as well for each radio input -> name ="option"
        -   [ ] input type = "number" -> use this when numbers are involved in forms
            -   [ ] min & max attribute -> set how high or low an input value can go
        -   [ ] input type = "submit" -> turns the input element into a button for submitting the form data
        -   [ ] input value = "Please Submit the Form!" -> this attribute can change the text of the "Submit" button
-   [ ] textarea element -> renders as a plain, mini-text editor on the web page
-   [ ] palceholder attribute -> some default text meant to explain what kind of data should be entered
-   [ ] validations -> making sure the right data is being entered into the forms
-   [ ] required attribute -> can be applied to one or more form inputs and it ensures that certain data has to be entered or the form cannot be submitted
